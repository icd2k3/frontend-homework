# Seed Frontend Homework

If you have any questions, or problems running the local build, please contact me at icd2k3@gmail.com.

## Setup

- Run `npm i` to install all project dependencies
- Run `npm run build` to bundle scripts
- Run `npm run start` to start dev server
- Open localhost:8080 in browser (Chrome preferred)

## Tools

- [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) I know, I know, the instructions said to use Flux for the data-layer, but Redux is very similar to Flux. There's a pretty good comparison post on the 2 [here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/32920459/1411364)
